The **Company Information Agent** is an intelligent AI-powered assistant built using **Azure AI Projects**.
It demonstrates how to create, configure, and interact with a custom AI agent that provides comprehensive company details, including contact info, mission, vision, values, and legal policies, using integrated function tools.

## üöÄ Overview

This project sets up and runs a **custom company information agent** using the `azure.ai.projects` SDK.
Once deployed, the agent can assist users by retrieving company details and answering questions about the organization‚Äôs policies, goals, and general information.

The agent configuration includes:

* **Name:** `company-info-agent-001`
* **Description:** A smart AI assistant for providing company-related details to users.
* **Instructions:** Guides the agent to provide accurate, clear, and professional responses about the company.

## üß© Features

* Create or reuse a company information agent dynamically.
* Manage threaded conversations with persistent context.
* Integrate user-defined Python tools (e.g., `get_company_details`) into the agent.
* Automatically execute and handle tool calls using Azure function tools.
* Communicate interactively with the agent via a command-line interface (CLI).
* Retrieve or delete existing agents and threads when needed.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

* **Python 3.10+**
* An **Azure account** with access to Azure AI Projects
* A **model deployment** available in your Azure environment
* Environment variables configured in a `.env` file

Example `.env` file:

```env
PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<your-azure-project-endpoint>
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-model-deployment-name>
AGENT_ID=<optional-existing-agent-id>
THREAD_ID=<optional-existing-thread-id>
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Agent

Run the Python CLI application:

```bash
python main.py   # with Python
uv run main.py   # with uv

## üß† Agent Configuration

```python
agent_name: str = "company-info-agent-001"

agent_description: str = (
    "A smart company information assistant designed to provide users with all relevant "
    "details about the company, including contact info, address, website, mission, vision, "
    "values, privacy policy, and terms and conditions."
)

agent_instructions: str = (

    "Always provide accurate, clear, and professional responses."
)
```

## üß∞ Tools and Functions

The agent includes a **custom toolset** defined in `tools.py`:

```python
def get_company_details():
    return {
        "name": "Tech Supplies Co.",
        "address": "123 Innovation Drive, Tech City",
        "contact": "+94123456789",
        "email": "contact@dileepa.dev",
        "website": "https://tech-inventory.dileepa.dev",
        "privacy_policy": "https://tech-inventory.dileepa.dev/privacy-policy",
        "terms_and_conditions": "https://tech-inventory.dileepa.dev/terms-and-conditions",
